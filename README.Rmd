# TensorClustering

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an R package to implement the Tensor Envelope Mixture Model (TEMM) and Doubly-Enhanced EM (DEEM) for tensor clustering. TEEM is from the paper "Tensor Envelope Mixture Model For Simultaneous Clustering and Multiway Dimension Reduction" by Deng and Zhang. DEEM is from the paper "A Doubly-Enhanced EM Algorithm for Model-Based Tensor Clustering" by Mai, Zhang, Pan and Deng.

## Installation

The [TensorClustering] package can be installed, directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/), using the devtools library:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("azuryee/TensorClustering")
library(TensorClustering)
```
