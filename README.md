# TensorClustering
This is an R package to the paper "Tensor Envelope Mixture Model For Simultaneous Clustering and Multiway Dimension Reduction" by Deng and Zhang. It implements the tensor envelope EM algorithm described in the paper to fit tensor envelope mixture model.

The TensorClustering package can be installed, directly from GitHub, using the devtools library:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("azuryee/TensorClustering")
library(TensorClustering)
