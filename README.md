This is an R package to the paper “Tensor Envelope Mixture Model For
Simultaneous Clustering and Multiway Dimension Reduction” by Deng and
Zhang. It implements the tensor envelope EM algorithm described in the
paper to fit tensor envelope mixture model.

## Installation

The [TensorClustering](#tensorclustering) package can be installed,
directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/), using the devtools library:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("azuryee/TensorClustering")
